            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">News is information about current events. This may be provided through
                many
                different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or
                through
                the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard news" to
                differentiate it
                from soft media.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics,
                education, health, the environment, economy,
                business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. Government
                proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed
                news
                since ancient times. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and
                espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its
                content.
                The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The spread of news has always been linked to the communications
                networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have
                historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could
                spread. Postal services have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power
                in a large area.

            One of the imperial communication channels, called the "Royal Road" traversed the Assyrian Empire
            and served as a key source of its power. The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads,
            known as cursus publicus, for similar purposes.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>
            Visible chains of long-distance signaling, known as optical telegraphy, have also been used
            throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and
            fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes. The latter form of
            optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">News can travel through different communication media.
                 In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a reporter,
                  where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or edited and manually set in 
                  type along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term "breaking news" 
                  has become trite as commercial broadcasting United States cable news services that are 
                  available 24 hours a day use live communications satellite technology to bring current 
                  events into consumers' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to 
                  become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via radio, 
                  television, mobile phone, and the internet.
                </p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.
